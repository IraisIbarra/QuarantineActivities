	<h2>What to do?</h2>
	<p>When the coronavirus caused us to go into <i title="a state of 'isolation'">quarantine</i> in March, I had no idea what to do with all the time I would be spending at home. Not being able to go out and meet up with friends was really difficult. I decided I needed to do something to help me stay <b style="color: cornflowerblue;">sane</b>.</p>

	<h3>Time to Get <i style="color:deeppink">Creative</i></h3>
	<p>I'm definitely not an artist, but I do enjoy being creative! I brainstormed a few creative things I could try, and then got to creating.</p>

	<h3>Let's Do Something <i style="color: mediumseagreen">New</i></h3>
	<p>Allowing myself to have creative outlets let me to wanting to learn new things. The kitchen is usually an intimidating place for me, I've never been a great cook. I asked my mom to teach me some of the recipes that she always made for us when we were living at home. And while I was learning new things, I decided I should teach my dog some new tricks as well!</p>
